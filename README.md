# Community Proposals

This is made to allow community to write proposals in a clean way. Here, we will be able to see proposed features clearly and able to discuss about it in a simple thread.


## How to?

First, You will need a github account (it's free and not invasive).

Second, write your post in Issues. If possible try to label it properly (but not mandatory, it's mostly to get a proper overview).

Once post is written, we will be able to discuss it here :)
